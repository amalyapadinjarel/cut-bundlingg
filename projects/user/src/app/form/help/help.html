    <h4>If org access is configured only via User application,</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> Effective org access is populated from the org access in User application.</li>
      <li> Default division and facility is populated from the configuration provided in the User application if it is specified in the user application.</li>
   
     </ul>
   
     <h4>If org access is configured only via Roles application,</h4>
     <ul>
       <li> Effective org access is populated from all roles accessible to the user based on the org access provided in the Roles application.</li>
       <li> Default division and facility is populated from the configuration provided in the roles.</li>
    
      </ul>
    
      <h4>If org access is configured in both User and  Roles application,</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Then the user will have access to the  division and facilities which are common to both the User and Roles application.</li>
        <li> Default division and facility is populated from the configuration provided in the User application if it is specified in the user application.</li>
     
       </ul>
